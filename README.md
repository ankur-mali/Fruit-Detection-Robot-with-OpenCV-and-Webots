# Fruit-Detection-Robot-with-OpenCV-and-Webots
This project demonstrates a fruit detection system using OpenCV for image processing and Webots for simulating robotic arm control. The system uses computer vision to identify objects, and a simulated robotic arm in Webots performs actions like picking and dropping fruits.
